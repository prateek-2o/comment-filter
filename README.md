**Terms and Conditions**

These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the Comment Filter application (“the App”), developed for use within Reddit communities via the Reddit Devvit platform.

The App is designed to assist subreddit moderators by automatically detecting low-effort comments and prompting users to add more meaningful content. The App does not remove content by default and does not make final moderation decisions.

The App is provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties of any kind, express or implied. The developer makes no guarantees regarding accuracy, reliability, or availability of the App.

By installing or using the App, moderators acknowledge that they are responsible for reviewing and configuring the App according to their community rules. The developer is not liable for any moderation actions, missed detections, or unintended behavior resulting from the App’s use.

The developer reserves the right to update, modify, or discontinue the App at any time.
